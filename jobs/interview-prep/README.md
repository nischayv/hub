#Interview Prep

When applying for internships and full-time jobs, most companies will assess your problem solving skills. We would like
to help you prepare for those interviews.

Here is a list of resources that will help you prepare, or brush up (if you are already a programming God) your problem solving skills.

* Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell (Available on Amazon)
* [Google Interview University] (https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university) (A github repo that covers all the concepts
  that you need to know for an interview)
* [Careercup] (https://www.careercup.com) (Website where people post solutions to interview
  questions they have had in the past)
* [Hackerrank] (https://www.hackerrank.com/) (Place to practice programming problems)
