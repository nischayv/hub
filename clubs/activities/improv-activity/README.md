# Improv Activity

This folder contains 8 slide decks for an improv activity. The goal of this activity is to get people out fo their comfort zone and practice public speaking skills in a low key environment. 

This activity can be done with groups presenting or an individual presenting. Call up the individual or the group and give them a random slide deck to present. The idea is that they will pretend like they know what is going on and give a fun presentation!
